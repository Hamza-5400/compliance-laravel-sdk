## Installation

To get started with the Compliance Laravel SDK, you can easily install it via Composer. Run the following command in your terminal:

```

### Downloading Releases

## Usage

Once you have installed the SDK, you can start using it in your Laravel application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

### Making API Calls

You can now use the SDK to make API calls. Hereâ€™s an example of how to create an invoice:

```php
use Hamza\Compliance\Facades\Compliance;

$invoiceData = [
    'amount' => 100.00,
    'currency' => 'SAR',
    'customer' => [
        'name' => 'John Doe',
        'email' => 'john@example.com',
    ],
];

$response = Compliance::createInvoice($invoiceData);

if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    echo "Invoice created successfully: " . $response->getInvoiceId();
} else {
    echo "Error: " . $response->getErrorMessage();
}
```

### Generating QR Codes

To generate a QR code, simply call the following method:

```php
$qrCodeData = Compliance::generateQRCode($invoiceId);
echo "QR Code: " . $qrCodeData;
```
